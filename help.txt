General Information

The purpose of this channel is to have a database of smurf accounts so anyone can play in any elo whenever they want to. The only supported ranks are as follows: Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Immortal, Radiant. If an account is unranked, please estimate the rank it last ended at and put a 0 for the rank number. If an account is Immortal or Radiant, please put 0 for the rank number. If an account has a status of "True", then it is currently in use. Otherwise, no one is using it. Please read the commands before asking the bot owner for help.
